<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>With the rise of quantum computing and AI-driven systems, conventional encryption models face many challenges in maintaining the confidentiality and reliability of sensitive information—especially in healthcare networks. While also addressing scalability and low-latency constraints essential for real-time applications. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a hybrid quantum–classical 6G framework that integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) within a unified secure communication layer. The proposed Multi-Link Loop (MLL) design establishes a self-regenerating and intrusion-resilient communication system that ensures seamless, termination-proof transmission of critical data under quantum-level threats by leveraging 6G’s adaptive ultra-low-latency capabilities. This integration builds a future-ready, quantum-secure foundation for next-generation digital ecosystems.</p><br>
